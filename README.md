Welcome to QuantaRoute!

A Python-driven simulator designed for grid and cylindrical topologies in quantum networks, featuring heterogeneous nodes to assess routing performance.

## Features

- **Node Efficiency Simulation:** Simulate varying efficiency levels across different quantum nodes.
- **Dynamic Routing Algorithms:** Test and evaluate Dijkstra's shortest-path and vertex-weighted Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **Performance Metrics:** Gather key performance metrics such as end-to-end fidelity, blocking probability, path establishment order, and the fraction of high-quality nodes.
- **Visual Network Representation:** View the quantum network topology.
  
## Installation

To get started with QuantaRoute, follow these simple installation instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vk9696/quantum-routing1.git
cd QuantaRoute
